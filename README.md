A collection of scripts to aid in Linux A/V capturing.

If you have a collection of scripts you'd like to add, please send a pull request.

## Organisation
The `dev` directory houses subdirectories for each device.
The subdirectory names begin with the device's `lsusb` ID.

In each device directory are scripts and a README.
The README includes general notes, as well as other names the device might be known under.
